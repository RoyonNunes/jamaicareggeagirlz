    <h1>Who Are the Jamaica Reggae Girlz?</h1>
    <p>
      The Jamaica women’s national football team, nicknamed the “Reggae Girlz,” is one of the top women’s national football teams in the Caribbean region, alongside Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti. In 2008, the team was disbanded after failing to advance from the group stage of Olympic Qualifying, which featured powerhouses like the United States and Mexico. The program was revived in 2014 after a six-year hiatus, finishing second at the 2014 Women’s Caribbean Cup after a 1–0 loss to Trinidad and Tobago in the final. The team is supported by ambassador Cedella Marley, daughter of Bob Marley, who has been instrumental in raising awareness, funding, and development for the team. Jamaica made history by qualifying for the FIFA Women’s World Cup for the first time in 2019, though they were eliminated in the group stage.
